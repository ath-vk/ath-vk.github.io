Qualifying for the 2020 ICPC Asia Amritapuri Doublesite Regional Contest was an incredible opportunity that allowed me to challenge myself and grow as a programmer. The ICPC is one of the most respected coding competitions worldwide, emphasizing teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Being part of the Asia regionals was a great experience that taught me so much and motivated me to keep improving. I'm grateful for the chance to compete and learn from some of the best in the field.
