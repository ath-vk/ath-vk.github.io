* Need for decentralization
    * A centralized lottery system has a central authority.
    * The central authority has the overall access to collect the amount and draw the winner.
    * They can manipulate and can also be biased in picking winner.
    * Also, centralized lottery will have a single point of failure.

* About the project
    * A decentralized lottery system disperses power.
    * No authority has any control over the amount, the smart contract's address will hold the entire amount.
    * The Winner will be picked by the deployer of the contract called as the manager.
    * The Winner will be decided by the random function which is cryptographically hashed and is almost impossible to predict.
