* Why do we require a decentralized rating system ?
    * Current rating systems are centralized having a complete control over the ratings database
    * Central authorities can edit / delete negative ratings to avoid their defamation.
    * It can led to huge rating scams with a purpose to attract buyers.

* How Blockchain will solve this problem ?

    * A Blockchain network is a decentralized, distributed ledger which has rigorous Cryptographic concepts, Consensus mechanisms which makes it reliable, trustworthy and impossible to hack.
    * Any thing written in blockchain canâ€™t be removed unless done legally, making rating systems consumer friendly.
    * It will also ensure that our system doesn't have single point of failure.

* Features
    * Provides trustworthy ratings for products.    
    * Ratings can't be manipulated illegally.   
    * Secured p2p payments using MetaMask.
