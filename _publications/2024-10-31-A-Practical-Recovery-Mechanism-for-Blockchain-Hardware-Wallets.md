excerpt: 'This work introduces a secure recovery mechanism for hardware wallets that preserves the unique security property of Unicity, crucial for protecting high-value cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional backups, it avoids cloning the private key by using Symmetric Secret Sharing, a Key Revocation Certificate, and Smart Contracts. This ensures wallet recovery without compromising security, outperforming existing methods and maintaining the integrity of the walletâ€™s design.'
