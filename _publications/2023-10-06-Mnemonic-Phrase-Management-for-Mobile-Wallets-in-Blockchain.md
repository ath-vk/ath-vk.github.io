excerpt: "The paper proposes a secure architecture for mobile blockchain wallets to address security challenges on mobile devices. It integrates a SIM card as a hardware component with a mnemonic phrase for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Additionally, it employs Shamir's secret sharing scheme to improve the walletâ€™s security and robustness. The proposed design is analyzed for its resilience against various types of attacks, aiming to enhance the overall security of mobile blockchain wallets and promote wider adoption of blockchain technology."
